### Suggestion: Relationship between climate and personal income by states

1. Collect state-level climate data using NOAA's Climate Data Online (CDO) API
 - retrieve extreme  weather indicators (e.g., average temperature, precipitation, frequency of extreme events) aggregated at the state level.

2. Collect state-level personal income data using the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) API
 - obtain annual measures such as total personal income and per capita personal income for each U.S. state.
 - align the time frame with the climate data for consistent panel analysis.

3. Analyze the relationship between state-level climate variables and personal income
conduct correlation analysis as a baseline.
 - extend to econometric methods (e.g. event-study models to capture causal impacts of extreme weather shocks on income growth) if possible.
 - discuss limitation (aggregation bias, omitted variables) and potential extensions (employment data).

4. Visualize findings on a U.S. map or through an interactive dashboard
 - create geographic heatmaps to show variation across states.
 - build an interactive dashboard to allow dynamic exploration of climate-income relationships if possible

This is just an example, so any other topic would be fine. (You can delete this.)
